# Locators

## Introduction

Locators are the central piece of KWIKQA's auto-waiting and retry-ability. In a nutshell, locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment.

These are the recommended built in locators.

- [getByRole()](#locate-by-role) to locate by explicit and implicit accessibility attributes.
- [getByText()](#locate-by-text) to locate by text content.
- [getByLabel()](#locate-by-label) to locate a form control by associated label's text.
- [getByPlaceholder()](#locate-by-placeholder) to locate an input by placeholder.
- [getByAltText()](#locate-by-alt-text) to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
- [getByTitle()](#locate-by-title) to locate an element by its title attribute.
- [getByTestId()](#locate-by-test-id) to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute (other attributes can be configured).

CSS and XPath are not recommended as the DOM can often change leading to non resilient tests. Instead, try to come up with a locator that is close to how the user perceives the page such as role locators or define an explicit testing contract using test ids.
- [getByCSS() or getByXPath()](/locators#locate-by-css-or-xpath) to locate an element using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

## Locating elements
KWIKQA comes with multiple built-in locators. To make tests resilient, we recommend prioritizing user-facing attributes and explicit contracts such as getByRole().

## Locate by role

The getByRole() locator reflects how users and assistive technology perceive the page, for example whether some element is a button or a checkbox. When locating by role, you should usually pass the accessible name as well, so that the locator pinpoints the exact element.

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<h3>Sign up</h3>
<label>
  <input type="checkbox" /> Subscribe
</label>
<br/>
<button>Submit</button>
// highlight-end

Role='heading', name='Sign up'
Role='checkbox', name='Subscribe'
Role='button', name='Submit'
```

## Locate by text

Find an element by the text it contains when using getByText().

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<h3>Sign up</h3>
// highlight-end

Text=Sign up
```

## Locate by label

Most form controls usually have dedicated labels that could be conveniently used to interact with the form. In this case, you can locate the control by its associated label using getByLabel().

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<label>Username <input type="text" /></label>
//highlight-end

Label=Username
```

## Locate by placeholder

Inputs may have a placeholder attribute to hint to the user what value should be entered. You can locate such an input using getByPlaceholder().

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<input type="email" placeholder="name@example.com" />
//highlight-end

Placeholder=name@example.com
```

## Locate by alt text

All images should have an alt attribute that describes the image. You can locate an image based on the text alternative using getByAltText().

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<img alt="kwikqa logo" src="/img/kwikqa-logo.svg" width="100" />
//highlight-end

AltText=kwikqa logo
```

## Locate by title

Locate an element with a matching title attribute using getByTitle().

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<span title='kwikqa'>Best Test Automation Framework</span>
//highlight-end

Title=kwikqa
```

## Locate by test id

Testing by test ids is the most resilient way of testing as even if your text or role of the attribute changes the test will still pass. QA's and developers should define explicit test ids and query them with getByTestId(). However testing by test ids is not user facing. If the role or text value is important to you then consider using user facing locators such as role and text locators.

**Usage**

For example, consider the following DOM structure.
```text
//highlight-start
<button data-testid="forms">Submit</button>
//highlight-end

TestId=forms
```

## Locate by CSS or XPath

If you absolutely must use CSS or XPath locators, you can use getByCSS() or getByXPath() to create a locator that takes a selector describing how to find an element in the page. 

**Usage**

For example
```text
css=button
xpath=//button
```

Note: The `css` and `xpath` locators are not recommended as they are not resilient to DOM changes. They can break easily if elements in the page change their role, text, or position.
