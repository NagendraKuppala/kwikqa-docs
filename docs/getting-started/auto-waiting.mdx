# Auto Waiting

## Introduction

KWIKQA performs a range of actionability checks on the elements before making actions to ensure these actions behave as expected. It auto-waits for all the relevant checks to pass and only then performs the requested action. If the required checks do not pass within the given `timeout`, action fails with the `TimeoutError`.

For example, for `click()`, KWIKQA will ensure that:

- locator resolves to an exactly one element
- element is [Visible](#visible)
- element is [Stable](#stable), as in not animating or completed animation
- element [Receives Events](#receives-events), as in not obscured by other elements
- element is [Enabled](#enabled)

Here is the complete list of actionability checks performed for each action:

| Action                   | [Visible](#visible) | [Stable](#stable) | [Receives Events](#receives-events) | [Enabled](#enabled) | [Editable](#editable) |
|--------------------------|---------|--------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| locator.check()          | Yes     | Yes    | Yes             | Yes     | -        |
| locator.click()          | Yes     | Yes    | Yes             | Yes     | -        |
| locator.dblclick()       | Yes     | Yes    | Yes             | Yes     | -        |
| locator.setChecked()     | Yes     | Yes    | Yes             | Yes     | -        |
| locator.uncheck()        | Yes     | Yes    | Yes             | Yes     | -        |

### Assertions

KWIKQA includes auto-retrying assertions that remove flakiness by waiting until the condition is met, similarly to auto-waiting before actions.

## Visible

Element is considered visible when it has non-empty bounding box and does not have visibility:hidden computed style.

Note that according to this definition:

- Elements of zero size are not considered visible.
- Elements with `display:none` are not considered visible.
- Elements with `opacity:0` are considered visible.

## Stable

Element is considered stable when it has maintained the same bounding box for at least two consecutive animation frames.

## Enabled

Element is considered enabled unless it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>` or `<textarea>` with a disabled property.

## Editable

Element is considered editable when it is enabled and does not have `readonly` property set.

## Receives Events

Element is considered receiving pointer events when it is the hit target of the pointer event at the action point. For example, when clicking at the point `(10;10)`, KWIKQA checks whether some other element (usually an overlay) will instead capture the click at `(10;10)`.

For example, consider a scenario where KWIKQA will click `Sign Up` button regardless of when the `locator.click()` call was made:

- page is checking that user name is unique and `Sign Up` button is disabled;
- after checking with the server, the disabled `Sign Up` button is replaced with another one that is now enabled.
